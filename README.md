- 👋 Hi, I’m @aicyp999, also known as Axel
- 👀 I’m interested in open source, games, art and technology. I hope that the world will become a better place, and that humanity as a whole, will become more social and more respectful of the ecosystems and the nature that is surrounding us...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning game development and art creation in order to create experiences that could inspire and grow people.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source or other projects aiming for the same world as mine.
